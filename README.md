### Features

1) GUI for starting/stopping health check

..* Used a charting library to graph / table continous data

2) Rolling data for the past 5 minutes
![demo-two](http://g.recordit.co/2k0grwkw9D.gif)
..*  Since data is updated approximately once per second, I used this approximation to store at most 300 ( 5 (minutes) * 60 seconds == 300 seconds) data points.
``` javascript
insertIndex =  counter % 300
```
Once all 300 slots in the array are filled, the next entry will be at index 0.
